<h2> Problem 1.1 </h2>
<p>

  LSTMs consist of chained, repeating modules.
The two pieces of information passed between the modules are the previous state (t-1) and the new input to state t.

 </p>

 <h2> Problem 1.2</h2>

 <p>
The problem is that RNNs can not derive and keep relationships between things far away for each other.
For example if the input is time variated, then inputs that are a long time apart are not easily related in RNNs due
mostly to the vanishing gradient problems of RNNs. LSTMs attempt to address this problem by partially forgetting
some state at each step; this selective 'remembering' makes it easier to relate two things which are far apart.
  </p>


<h2> Problem 1.3 </h2>
<p>

   In one of these views, we think of the RNN as being "unrolled" into a chain of repeating modules.
  What values (represented with tensors) are shared between these modules, and what values are different?
  (The answer is slightly confusing when thinking about training, so just think about using the model for prediction.)

The values shared between the modules (input output state?)

 </p>

 <h2> Problem 1.4 </h2>

 <p>

The sigmoid non linearity is used here instead of Relu since the current state vector needs to be multiplied by a number in the
range 0 - 1 as the output represents the amount of state we want to remember at that particular stage in the network.

  </p>



  <h2> Problem 2.1 </h2>
  <p>

    After running for 16 epochs, the model achieved a perplexity of 3.46.
    However, the variablity of perplexity is still very high (3-8).
Since this is much closer to 0 than initally, this shows the prediction is quite good.
Examples of your generated sentence results here are : It looks, you will made, your think ang ago.
   </p>

   <h2> Problem 2.2</h2>

   <p>
Softmax sample temperature determines probabilities of predition outputs, changing
what commonality of words are outputted. I found that a balance produced the most natural seeming text,
of around 0.35-0.4.

Examples of your generated sentence results:
I will love the whole the star.
I want my way the so wan don't do you to the lights the stand you don't gonna the word all the stand.
I will for how the ready no me the love the star.

    </p>


  <h2> Problem 2.3 </h2>
  <p>

Observations: The sentences are running loaded on Dr Seuss and Adele data. The text definitely reflects the vocabulary
of the input data sources. In general as well, the style of writing is replicated. Dr Seuss has many repeated frames,
and this motif is carried forward into the observed genereated sentences as well. It is harder, however, to reason
in terms of sentence length as inputs and outputs have both varying lengths of sentences.
There is repeated vocabularly/sentence structure where sentences begin similarly:
"I will ....." and "Oh, ....." "When the...." and "But, ...."
   </p>

   <h2> Problem 2.4 </h2>

   <p>

 4. Try changing the model parameters and initialization.
 Record your observations from at least one of these experiments. Some ideas are:
   -  Increase or decrease the embedding size for the inputs
   -  Increase or decrease the size of the hidden layers of each cell
   -  Adjust the learning rate (Be careful: if the learning rate is too high, the perplexity may explode.)
   -  Change the generator from LSTM to RNN.

I changed the model parameters for RNN as follows:
I increased the embedding size by 2 times, and decreased the hidden layer size of each cell by half.
I decreased the learning rate to 0.00008.
Observation here is that I had to train the model for many more epochs to get some sort of cohesive language output.
Also, the vocabulary similarity was the defining 'state of memory' which was passed into the output sentences.

    </p>
    <h2> Optional 2.4 </h2>
    <p>
      Here, I passed in two very different types of data, both in the English language.
      I used Justin Bieber lyrics which are normally extremely repetitive (such as Baby) and I used
      a text analysis from Geoff Schreeves of a champions league football game. The language is much more varied and also different
      from Justin Bieber.

  Some sentences outputted using an LSTM model with a lower learning rate (0.00005) and after 20 epochs are:

  "Oh them pass on to her", "Cause me pain from football" were good examples of mixing these two datasets.
