<h2> Problem 1 </h2>
<p>
The reward scheme for Frozen Lake is as follows:
When you reach the goal, there is a reward of +1.
Otherwise, all other states have rewards of 0.
However, when you reach either the goal or a Hole state, then the game is terminated.
 </p>

 <h2> Problem 2</h2>

 <p>
   The table needs to contain a Q reward for every possible action in every possible state.
   There are 16 states and 4 actions per state, therefore this table would have to be 16 by 4 = size 64.
  </p>


<h2> Problem 3 </h2>
<p>
  Yes the rewards improve over time, because the action is greedily picked as the argmax from the Q table.
  This is done repeatedely, and the reward table is updated based on the argmax so the rewards are improving over time.

 <h2> Problem 4 </h2>

 <p>
   I provided my code above. I tried a few different configurations. When I decreased the learning rate and the discount rate,
   I saw that the rewards did not update as rapidly over the course of the procedure. Since the discount rate discounts future rewards, and near-zero
   rates mean that the algorithm becomes very myopic, only focusing on short term rewards.
