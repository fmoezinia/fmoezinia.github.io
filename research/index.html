 Some topics I've explored
</h3>
<br>

	<p><center><b>Zero Knowledge Range Proofs</b> </center>
We (Novi Crypto Research) published a paper on <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/297">range proofs</a>. These have loads of applications, from proving income ranges (ZK accreditation) to ZK geolocation.
<br><br>

<p><center><b>Heterogeneous POW Consensus Protocols</b> </center>
  I wrote a paper on how heterogeneous network conditions affect distributed systems with a friend at MIT.

As blockchain systems scale, and network parameters are taken to the limit, network conditions may impact consensus protocols.
I analyzed the impact of heterogeneous network conditions on consensus protocols as block times tend towards their limit.
By simulating POW protocols in a heterogeneous peer-to-peer networks, I was able to break consensus by performing an attack with less than 50% malicious hash power.
This research aims to raise awareness about disparate network conditions in systems with short interblock times, and suggests alterations to
random peering mechanisms such as Bitcoin's.

<p><center><b>Digital Currency Initiative - MIT Media Lab</b> </center>
  I worked on enabling <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/smart-contracts/">Discreet Log Contracts</a> in Lightning, a Bitcoin L2. These can primarily be used as onchain BTC futures contracts.
<br>


<p><center><b>Adversarial Infill</b></center>
  Semantic infilling involves filling in significant portions of corrupted images. I explored adversarial methods of achieving semantic infilling on
  faces. I used a DCGAN (deep convolutional generative adversarial network) trained on facial images to reconstruct portions of images.
