        <h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

            I'm a software engineer working in DeFi, trying to use cryptography to improve payments and other financial products.
	    I used to work as a blockchain engineer on <b>Novi</b> and <b>Diem (ex Libra)</b> at Facebook. I also ran a digital asset multi-strategy fund, <b>Leo Capital</b>.

<center><b>Decentralized Ethereum Derivates Exchange</b></center>
     A friend and I built an options exchange derivative on Ethereum.
     We created a manual order execution exchange for ETH options, using Oraclize for price feeds and IPFS to offload data.
	    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW_OHJ2r4ck&feature=youtu.be">Live demo of the app</a>, and
	    <a href="https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2018/project/Moezinia-Forde-Magendanz-EthExch.pdf">paper here</a>.
<br><br>
	    
<center><b>Hide</b></center>
I built a Chrome extension to harness remote CPU cycles to mine Monero. <a href="https://medium.com/@fredricmoezinia/the-vulnerability-nobody-wants-to-fix-17d58232ff76">Click here for an article I wrote about my findings.</a></center>
<br><br>

<center><b>Cryptotrage</b></center>
I used to build market making and taking bots, using simple graph algorithms to find multi hop cross-exchange price arbitrages.
Assets needed to be distributed across exchanges in the right amounts to execute - forecasting arbitrage windows and relocating
	    was more complex than actually finding the mispricings in real-time.
With market making back in 2015, I was able to consistently represent spreads representing up to ~10% of prices and for half a year, I was the only market maker for two low volume tokens.

<center><b>Puma</b></center>
I built an iOS application which stores your notes in the cloud encrypted using private keys from the iphone's secure enclave. (Hybrid encryption for top performance and security.)
Login with biometrics and a passphrase to decrypt your notes, so noone else can see them even if the storage server is hacked.
<br><br>

	 <center><b>Lucky 13</b></center>
A group of us entered a competition to build an autonomous robot to race around a ~100m track and then to escape a Labyrinth with no prior data. We worked on localization, mapping, control and path planning using ROS (Robotic Operating System).

<br><br>

<center><b>StyleX</b></center>
Although design is not my forte, I tried to create a personalizable website so you can store all your clothes and belogings online. Not only that, but you can try different outfits on a virtual-YOU to see what looks best. Save the outfits that look good.

<br><br>

	    <center><b>LazyMe</b></center><br>
I built a program to do my Spanish Homework for me. Perdón, Señor Garcia! I had a semesters worth (1000s) of online exercises to do; so I wrote a script to navigate through the exercises and submit all the correct answers for me. I got an A.

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Some Research
</h3>

	<p><center><b>Zero Knowledge Range Proofs</b> </center>
We (Novi Crypto Research) published a paper on <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/297">range proofs</a>. These have loads of applications, from proving income ranges (ZK accreditation) to ZK geolocation.
<br><br>
		
<p><center><b>Heterogeneous POW Consensus Protocols</b> </center>
As blockchain systems scale, and network parameters are taken to the limit, network conditions may impact consensus protocols.
I analyzed the impact of heterogeneous network conditions on consensus protocols as block times tend towards their limit.
By simulating POW protocols in a heterogeneous peer-to-peer networks, I was able to break consensus by performing an attack with less than 50% malicious hash power.
This research aims to raise awareness about disparate network conditions in systems with short interblock times, and suggests alterations to
random peering mechanisms such as Bitcoin's.
<br><br>

<p><center><b>Digital Currency Initiative - MIT Media Lab</b> </center>
  I worked on enabling <a href="https://dci.mit.edu/smart-contracts/">Discreet Log Contracts</a> in Lightning, a Bitcoin L2. These can primarily be used as onchain BTC futures contracts.
<br>


<p><center><b>Adversarial Infill</b></center>
  Semantic infilling involves filling in significant portions of corrupted images. I explored adversarial methods of achieving semantic infilling on
  faces. I used a DCGAN (deep convolutional generative adversarial network) trained on facial images to reconstruct portions of images.
<br><br>


<center><b>Research Science Institute (RSI) at MIT</b></center>
At RSI, I wrote a paper on optimizing dynamic path planning algorithms for Martian robots.<br>
