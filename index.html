        <h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

            I'm a software engineer working in DeFi, trying to use cryptography to improve payments and other financial products.
	    I used to work as a blockchain engineer on <b>Novi</b> and <b>Diem (ex Libra)</b> at Facebook. I also ran a digital asset multi-strategy fund, <b>Leo Capital</b>.

<center><b>Decentralized Ethereum Derivates Exchange</b></center><br>
     A friend and I built a decentralized options exchange derivative on Ethereum.
     We created a manual order execution exchange for ETH options, using Oraclize for price feeds and IPFS to offload data.

<br><br>



<center><b>Hide</b></center><br>
I built a Chrome extension to harnesses remote CPU cycles to mine Monero. <a href="https://medium.com/@fredricmoezinia/the-vulnerability-nobody-wants-to-fix-17d58232ff76">Click here for an article I wrote about my findings.</a></center>
<br><br>

<center><b>Cryptotrage</b></center><br>

I used to build market making and taking bot - used simple graph algorithms to find multi hop cross-exchange price arbitrages.
Assets needed to be distributed across exchanges in the right amounts to execute - forecasting arbitrage windows and relocating
	    was more complex than actually finding the mispricings in real-time.
With market making back in 2015, I was able to consistently represent spreads representing up to ~10% of prices and for half a year, I was the only market maker for two low volume tokens.
<br><br>


<center><b>Puma</b></center><br>
I built an iOS application which stores your notes in the cloud encrypted using private keys from the iphone's secure enclave. (Hybrid encryption for top performance and security.)
Login with biometrics and a passphrase to decrypt your notes, so noone else can see them even if the storage server is hacked.
<br><br>


<center><b>Random Sanity Project</b></center><br>
I worked with Gavin Andresen (Bitcoin dev) on the Random Sanity Project at its inception in 2017.
We developed a tool to prevent non-random seeding of numbers, which can lead to major security vulnerabilities.
<br><br>


	 <center><b>Lucky 13</b></center><br>
I created the software for a self driving vehicle (with a Hokuyo Lidar) for two autonomous-driving competitions with four friends.
The first was to have the vehicle drive as quickly as possible around a ~100m track with no intervention. The second was to have the robot escape an unknown Labyrinth autonomously with no prior knowledge. Specifically, I worked on localization, mapping, safety control, path and motion planning using ROS (Robotic Operating System).

<center><b>StyleX</b></center><br>

Although design is not my forte, I tried to create a personalizable website so you can store all your clothes and belogings online. Not only that, but you can try different outfits on a virtual-YOU to see what looks best. Save the outfits that look good.

	    <center><b>LazyMe</b></center><br>
I built a program to do my Spanish Homework for me. Perdón, Señor Garcia! I had a semesters worth (1000s) of online exercises to do; so I wrote a script to navigate through the exercises and submit all the correct answers for me. I got an A.

</h3>

	<p><center><b>Zero Knowledge Range Proofs</b> </center><br>
I published a paper with Novi Crypto Research about <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/297">range proofs</a>. These have a ton of applications from proving income ranges (ZK accreditation) to ZK geolocation.
<br><br>
		
<p><center><b>Heterogeneous POW Consensus Protocols</b> </center><br>
As blockchain systems scale, and network parameters are taken to the limit, network conditions may impact consensus protocols.
I analyzed the impact of heterogeneous network conditions on consensus protocols as block times tend towards their limit.
By simulating POW protocols in a heterogeneous peer-to-peer networks, I was able to break consensus by performing an attack with less than 50% malicious hash power.
This research aims to raise awareness about disparate network conditions in systems with short interblock times, and suggests alterations to
random peering mechanisms such as Bitcoin's.
<br><br>

<p><center><b>Digital Currency Initiative - MIT Media Lab</b> </center>
  <center><a href="https://dci.mit.edu/smart-contracts/">See project description</a></center><br>
  I worked on enabling Discreet Log Contracts in Lightning, a layer 2 Bitcoin solution. These are forward or future contracts
  which can be used by investors to hedge against volatile Bitcoin prices. Specifically, I am working on in-channel contracts to allow
  parties to trade forwards in a scalable manner.
<br><br>

<p><center><b>Indoor Localization</b> </center><br>
In a team of 4, we built an Android application using RSS (received signal strength) fingerprinting and inferred motion techniques in order to infer indoor localization much better than GPS or wifi can on its own.
Used HMMs (hidden markov models), android's accelerometer and receiver to achieve fine grained localization in MIT building 69 better than iphone/android can.
<br><br>

<p><center><b>Secure Remote File System</b> </center><br>
Built a multi-client secure remote file system providing integrity in the face of an untrusted server. This was based on the SUNDR paper, an early blockchain-like implementation.
<br><br>


<p><center><b>Adversarial Infill</b> </center><br>
  Semantic infilling involves filling in significant portions of corrupted images. I explored adversarial methods of achieving semantic infilling on
  faces. I used a DCGAN (deep convolutional generative adversarial network) trained on facial images to reconstruct portions of images.
<br><br>

<p><center><b>Changing Places - MIT Media Lab</b> </center>
  <center><a href="http://cp.media.mit.edu/pev/">Visit the Project Site</a></center><br>
  The research goal here was to autonomize an on-demand, shared, last mile transport service. This is in an effort to replace city bike schemes like Citi Cycles in New York or Boris Bikes in London, and revolutionize the 'last-mile' commute.
 I simulated travel routes with real, public (subway) and private (Uber) transport data across cities. See an example of the protoyped buggies in Boston:

<center><b>Research Science Institute (RSI) at MIT</b></center><br>
<center> “Optimizing Dynamic Path Planning Algorithms for Mars Data Collection Mission Using Tailored Gaussian Process”.</center><br>
I conducted research at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Inteligence Laboratories (CSAIL) and presented in a scientific symposium at MIT Sloane. The research paper was awarded ‘Highly Commended’ in the UK National Science and Engineering Competition CompSci category.<br><br>
