<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>


I am currently studying Computer Science Engineering and Economics at MIT. I'm specializing in cryptographic systems as I continue towards a Masters of Engineering also at MIT.
<br><br>When I'm not staring at my computer, I love to play poker, football and tennis with my friends at MIT. And if I'm feeling adventurous, I hop in the nearest Piper Warrior and take some friends for an aerial tour of Boston.

<br>

<center><b>Cryptotrage</b></center><br>
 I built a digital currency trading bot. Back when markets for digital currencies were less efficient and volatile, statistical arbitrage could be used to profit from certain currency exchanges discrepancies.
 Using developer APIs to get trade information, my bot found and forecast mispricings. This was a scary bot to run for a 19 year old with little liquidity; this notion of conducting arbitrage in cryptocurrency circles is outdated due to increased players in the market and long transaction times.
<br><br> More recently, I acted as a Marker Marker in a few low volume cryptocurrency markets. I was able to consistently find bid-ask spreads representing up to ~20% of market price. 
	<br>    <br> I am now working with Gavin Andresen (Bitcoin's ex lead developer) on the Random Sanity Project, to find simple ways for comapnies to ensure they are running secure software.<br><br>


 <center><b>ETH-Derivs</b></center><br>
	    I am creating a decentralized Ethereum Derivative Exchange on the Ethereum Blockchain with two friends at MIT. Option contracts are fulfilled in a decentralized fashion via Smart Contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain.
<br><br>
	    
	    <center><b>LazyMe</b></center><br>
I built a program to do my Spanish Homework for me. Pardon, Señor Garcia! I had a semesters worth (1000s) of online exercises to do; so I wrote a script to navigate through the exercises and submit all the correct answers for me. I got an A.
<br><br>

<center><b>Hide</b></center><br>
I built a Chrome extension that mined Monero on users' CPUs as part of an experiment. For more details, please .

<br><br>

<center><b>StyleX</b></center><br>
<a href="https://stylex.herokuapp.com/">Check it out here0</a>	    
Although design is not my forte, I did create a personalizable website so you can store all your clothes and belogings online. Not only that, but you can try different outfits on a virtual-YOU to see what looks best. Save the outfits that look good.

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Internships
</h3>

<p><center><b>Facebook</b> </center><br>
I will be working at Facebook in the summer of 2018 in Menlo Park.
<br><br>

	<p><center><b>Airware, Inc.</b> </center><br>
  <center><a href="http://www.airware.com/industries/view-all">Airware Solutions</a></center><br>
  I orchestrated automated continuous integration tests of the entire Airware cloud with Kubernetes as containerized service. I also
decoupled heavy static data from applications and tests, and lead a data transition to distributed networked file storage systems.
   <br><br>


<p><center><b>Changing Places - MIT Media Lab</b> </center><br>
  <center><a href="http://cp.media.mit.edu/pev/">Visit the Project Site</a></center><br>
  Our Lab’s goal is to autonomize an on-demand, shared, electric buggy transport service. This is in an effort to replace city bike schemes like Citi Cycles in New York, and revolutionize the 'last-mile' commute. I am simulating travel routes with real, public (subway) and private (Uber) transport data across cities. See an example of our protoyped buggies in Boston:

	 <center><b>B2W Digital, Rio de Janeiro</b> </center>	<br>
  <center><a href="https://www.b2wdigital.com/en/institucional/estrategia-e-vantagens-competitivas/">Pricing Team</a></center><br>
	I am using a suite of learning algorithms to price products dynamically. Specifically, I am optmizing product and S&ampH (Shipping and Handling) costs using a suite of Random Forest algorithms.
I am training the algorithms which use a number of variables, like competitor price, traffic data and product stock.<br><br>



 <center><b>Paribus Co.</b> </center>	<br>
  <center><a href="https://paribus.co/">Paribus Home</a></center><br>
I spearheaded a new product feature which scrapes and exploits online hotel bookings’ price inefficiencies. This arbitrating on hotel reservations saved Paribus customers' $50K in its first month. My Hotel Booking saving feature (alongisde Retail and Credit Cards) worked towards Capital One's multi-million dollar acquisition of Paribus.

<p><center><b>Zinc Technologies Inc.</b> </center><br>
	<center><a href="https://zinc.io/">Zinc Products</a></center><br>

I lead a branch of this Y-Combinator graduated company, developing an application for customers to automatically purchase Amazon products over SMS directly. I also automated Zinc's client charges for its automated eCommerce Arbitrage platform<br><br>



<center><b>ALMA Observatory,	Chile</b></center><br>
  	<center><a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/alma.html">Alma Research</a></center><br>

I designed a Graphical User Interface to aid pre-emptive maintenance of the cryostatic systems of ALMA’s Front End system antennas.<br>	<br>






<center><b>Research Science Institute (RSI) at MIT</b></center><br><br>

<center> “Optimizing Dynamic Path Planning Algorithms for Mars Data Collection Mission Using Tailored Gaussian Process”.</center><br>

I conducted research at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Inteligence Laboratories (CSAIL) and presented in a scientific symposium at MIT Sloane. The research paper was awarded ‘Highly Commended’ in the UK National Science and Engineering Competition CompSci category.<br><br>
