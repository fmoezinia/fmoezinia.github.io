        <h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

        	    I am currently working as a blockchain engineer on <b>Novi</b> and <b>Diem (ex Libra)</b> at Facebook. I also run a digital asset multi-strategy fund called <b>Leo Capital</b>.
                I am primarily interested in applying cryptographic solutions to improve financial services (payments, credit, insurance...) products.

                <br><br>Before joining the Libra project, I was a quant developer at <b>Point 72</b>, in their propietary systematic trading wing (Cubist Systematic Strategies), working on low latency equity trade execution.
                <br><br>While studying CS and Economics at <b>MIT</b> in 2015, my foray into crypto began when I built a decentralized options exchange on Ethereum with a friend - it was one of the first DeFi projects, second of its kind globally.

<h3><a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Leo Capital</h3>
In 2019 I started a crypto fund investing in hybrid token and equity assets. We are seed venture investors and run a long-neutral-short portfolio.
 We employ a range of trading strategies based on in-house quant research (automated market making, stat-arb and yield farming). As investors and advisors, we help with everything from system architecture planning to ecosystem strategy, product growth and hiring. <a href="mailto:moeziniaf@gmail.com">Contact me</a> for more information about our strategies and advisorship.

<h3><a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Diem (ex Libra) ‪≋ Novi (Facebook)</h3>
 I have helped architect and support several components across Diem Core (blockchain network) and Novi (digital wallet).
Primarily, I design and build out secure infrastructure for the blockchain and wallet's most sensitive components: root governance accounts and funded wallet accounts. We designed new HSM-based Custody solutions for all Novi users' funds (cold/warm/hot wallets), and hold patents for these.
These designs scale to 500M-1B users and offer much better security guarantees than probably any other blockchain/wallet combination.
I also architechted and built the mint and burn service for Diem.
I work closely with the Cryptography Research team, publishing papers on topics such as <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/297">zero knowledge range proofs</a>.

<center><b>Decentralized Ethereum Derivates Exchange</b></center><br>
     I created a Ethereum distributed application (dApp) to allow for decentralized Ethereum derivative trading with a friend at MIT.
	This was the second decentralized ETH exchange created globally.<br>
     Specifically, we created a manual order execution exchange for options trading of ETH.
     Options are trustlessly and securely held in smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain,
     meaning no dependency on any third party. We use Oraclize for provably secure pricing data retrieval,
     and IPFS to reduce blockchain storage in a cryptographically secure way.

<center><b>Hide</b></center><br>
I surreptiously mined Monero on over 1000 remote devices as part of a security experiment.
This was achieved by controlling users' CPUs to conduct in browser mining via a Chrome extension.

<br><br>

<center><b>Cryptotrage</b></center><br>

I ran a market making and taking book for 2 years, when cryptomarkets were more volatile and had cross-exchange inefficiencies.
I initially built an arbitrage trading bot to find inefficiencies across exchanges using a algorithm based on graph theory.
This was challenging as assets needed to be distributed and constantly relocated across exchanges at the same time. Since rebalancing assets and preempting arbitrage windows
	    was more complex than finding the mispricings in real-time, I had to forecast asset placement across exchanges to seriously profit from the arbitrage opportunities.
	    It's worth noting that tested stat-arb techniques here were far less profitable than pure coin mispricings.
<br><br> More recently, I acted as a Marker Marker in several low volume cryptocurrency markets.
For a time, I was able to consistently represent bid-ask spreads representing up to ~15% of market price.
	    I came up with an automatic market making strategy fine-tuned to specific exchanges and coins. For half a year, I was the only market maker for certain payments methods for two cryptocurrencies.
	    This was orders of magntiudes more profitable than collecting via arbitrage.

<center><b>Puma</b></center><br>
I built an iOS application which stores your notes in the cloud encrypted using private keys from the iphone's secure enclave. (Hybrid encryption for top performance and security.)
Login with biometrics and a passphrase to decrypt your notes, so noone else can see them even if the storage server is hacked.
<br><br>


<center><b>Random Sanity Project</b></center><br>
I worked with Gavin Andresen (Bitcoin's ex lead developer) on the Random Sanity Project at its inception in 2017.
We developed a tool to prevent non-random seeding of numbers, which can lead to major security vulnerabilities.
<br><br>


	 <center><b>Lucky 13</b></center><br>
I created the software for a self driving vehicle (with a Hokuyo Lidar) for two autonomous-driving competitions with four friends.
The first was to have the vehicle drive as quickly as possible around a ~100m track with no intervention. The second was to have the robot escape an unknown Labyrinth autonomously with no prior knowledge. Specifically, I worked on localization, mapping, safety control, path and motion planning using ROS (Robotic Operating System).

<br>

<center><b>StyleX</b></center><br>

Although design is not my forte, I did create a personalizable website so you can store all your clothes and belogings online. Not only that, but you can try different outfits on a virtual-YOU to see what looks best. Save the outfits that look good.

	    <center><b>LazyMe</b></center><br>
I built a program to do my Spanish Homework for me. Perdón, Señor Garcia! I had a semesters worth (1000s) of online exercises to do; so I wrote a script to navigate through the exercises and submit all the correct answers for me. I got an A.

Past Work Experiences
</h3>

<p><center><b>Cubist Systematic Strategies</b> </center><br>
I worked at Point72's systematic quant prop trading wing, on a team called Ohms - we provided low latency trade execution for 90% of Point72 and Cubist trades.
We are the outbound route to global exchanges and dark pools, primarily handling equities. I spent a long time profiling and reducing latency on Ohms' critical path.
I also helped a trading team replay 10 years of market data from multiple exchanges
using a custom allocator, lock free Queue primitives, and compression algorithms for back testing.
<br><br>

<p><center><b>Instagram</b> </center><br>
I worked on the Instagram Account Security Team in 2018, providing 1 billion IG users
with simple and secure access to their accounts. I created a risk-based authentication system
which interfaces with tens of billions of IG requests per day. This system uses many indicators to authenticate or revoke trust from accounts.

<br><br>

	<p><center><b>Airware, Inc.</b> </center><br>
  <center><a href="http://www.airware.com/industries/view-all">Airware Solutions</a></center><br>
  I orchestrated automated continuous integration tests of the entire Airware cloud with Kubernetes as containerized service. I also
decoupled heavy static data from applications and tests, and lead a data transition to distributed networked file storage systems.
 I also wrote a lot of test cases!
   <br><br>


	 <center><b>B2W Digital, Rio de Janeiro</b> </center>	<br>
  <center><a href="https://www.b2wdigital.com/en/institucional/estrategia-e-vantagens-competitivas/">Pricing Team</a></center><br>
	I used a suite of learning algorithms to price products dynamically. Specifically, I optimized product and S&ampH (Shipping and Handling) costs using a suite of Random Forest algorithms.
  I designed a max revenue pricing model for online sales by training models using traffic data, product stock and compeititor prices.
<br><br>



 <center><b>Paribus Co.</b> </center>	<br>
  <center><a href="https://paribus.co/">Paribus Home</a></center><br>
I spearheaded a new product feature which scrapes and exploits online hotel bookings’ price inefficiencies. This arbitraging on hotel reservations saved Paribus customers' $50K in its first month. My Hotel Booking saving feature (alongisde Retail and Credit Cards) helped work towards Capital One acquisition of Paribus. The founding team now is building Ramp.

<p><center><b>Zinc Technologies Inc.</b> </center><br>
	<center><a href="https://zinc.io/">Zinc Products</a></center><br>

I lead a branch of this Y-Combinator graduated company, developing an application for customers to automatically purchase Amazon products over SMS directly. I also automated Zinc's client charges for its automated eCommerce Arbitrage platform<br><br>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Research
</h3>

<p><center><b>Heterogeneous POW Consensus Protocols</b> </center><br>
As blockchain systems scale, and network parameters are taken to the limit, network conditions may impact consensus protocols.
I analyzed the impact of heterogeneous network conditions on consensus protocols, especially as block time is on the order of seconds.
By simulating POW protocols in a heterogeneous peer-to-peer networks, I was able to break consensus by performing an attack with less than 50% malicious hash power.
This research aims to raise awareness about disparate network conditions in systems with short interblock times, and suggests alterations to
random peering mechanisms such as Bitcoin's.
<br><br>

<p><center><b>Digital Currency Initiative - MIT Media Lab</b> </center>
  <center><a href="https://dci.mit.edu/smart-contracts/">See project description</a></center><br>
  I worked on enabling Discreet Log Contracts in Lightning, a layer 2 Bitcoin solution. These are forward or future contracts
  which can be used by investors to hedge against volatile Bitcoin prices. Specifically, I am working on in-channel contracts to allow
  parties to trade forwards in a scalable manner.
<br><br>

<p><center><b>Indoor Localization</b> </center><br>
In a team of 4, we built an Android application using RSS (received signal strength) fingerprinting and inferred motion techniques in order to infer indoor localization much better than GPS or wifi can on its own.
Used HMMs (hidden markov models), android's accelerometer and receiver to achieve fine grained localization in MIT building 69 better than iphone/android can.
<br><br>

<p><center><b>Secure Remote File System</b> </center><br>
Built a multi-client secure remote file system providing integrity in the face of an untrusted server. This was based on the SUNDR paper, an early blockchain-like implementation.
<br><br>


<p><center><b>Adversarial Infill</b> </center><br>
  Semantic infilling involves filling in significant portions of corrupted images. I explored adversarial methods of achieving semantic infilling on
  faces. I used a DCGAN (deep convolutional generative adversarial network) trained on facial images to reconstruct portions of images.
<br><br>

<p><center><b>Changing Places - MIT Media Lab</b> </center>
  <center><a href="http://cp.media.mit.edu/pev/">Visit the Project Site</a></center><br>
  The research goal here was to autonomize an on-demand, shared, last mile transport service. This is in an effort to replace city bike schemes like Citi Cycles in New York or Boris Bikes in London, and revolutionize the 'last-mile' commute.
 I simulated travel routes with real, public (subway) and private (Uber) transport data across cities. See an example of the protoyped buggies in Boston:

   <center><b>ALMA Observatory,	Chile</b></center>
     	<center><a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/alma.html">Alma Research</a></center><br>

   I designed a Graphical User Interface to aid pre-emptive maintenance of the cryostatic systems of ALMA’s Front End system antennas.<br>	<br>


<center><b>Research Science Institute (RSI) at MIT</b></center><br>
<center> “Optimizing Dynamic Path Planning Algorithms for Mars Data Collection Mission Using Tailored Gaussian Process”.</center><br>
I conducted research at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Inteligence Laboratories (CSAIL) and presented in a scientific symposium at MIT Sloane. The research paper was awarded ‘Highly Commended’ in the UK National Science and Engineering Competition CompSci category.<br><br>
