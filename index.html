<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>


I am a Computer Science and Economics student at MIT, living in Boston, MA. I am interested in a range of fields including blockchain technology, cybersecurity and robotics.
<br><br>When I'm not staring at my computer, I like to play tennis or poker for fun. If I'm feeling adventurous, I hop in the nearest Cherokee or Cessna and take a few friends for an aerial tour of Boston.

<center><b>Cryptotrage</b></center><br>
 Back when cryptocurrency markets were less efficient and more volatile, prices varied wildly across exchanges. I have been trading currencies since 2013 and in 2015, I built a trading bot to find inefficiencies and forecast low-risk trades.

 Using statiscial arbitrage techniques (graph theory algorithms), I was able to profit from mispricings.
Nonetheless, this was scary to run autonomously for a 19 year-old with little liquidity, especially as many assets were needed to be distributed across exchanges at the same time.

This notion of conducting arbitrage in cryptocurrency circles is outdated due to increased market actors, nonzero transaction times and fees.
<br><br> More recently, I acted as a Marker Marker in several low volume cryptocurrency markets. I was able to consistently find bid-ask spreads representing up to ~20% of market price. Market Making ended up being orders of magntiude more profitable than conducting stat arb.

<center><b><a href="https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.857/2018/project/Moezinia-Forde-Magendanz-EthExch.pdf">Decentralized ETH Exchange</a></b></center><br>
     I created a Ethereum distributed application (dApp) to allow for decentralized Ethereum derivative trading with a friend at MIT. Specifically, we created a manual order execution exchange for Ethereum Options. Options are trustlessly and securely held in smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain, meaning there is no reliance on a third party. We use Oraclize to retrieve provably secure price data, and IPFS to reduce blockchain storage in a cryptographically secure way.

<br>
<center><b>Hide</b></center><br>
I surreptiously mined Monero on over 1000 remote devices as part of a security experiment.
This was achieved by controlling users' CPUs to conduct in browser mining via a Chrome extension.

<br><br>

<center><b>Random Sanity Project</b></center><br>
I worked with Gavin Andresen (Bitcoin's ex lead developer) on the Random Sanity Project at its inception in 2017.
We developed a tool to prevent non-random seeding of numbers, which can lead to major security vulnerabilities.
<br><br>


	 <center><b>Lucky 13</b></center><br>
I created the software for a self driving vehicle (with a Hokuyo Lidar) for two autonomous-driving competitions with four friends.
The first was to have the vehicle drive as quickly as possible around a ~100m track with no intervention. The second was to have the robot escape an unknown Labyrinth autonomously with no prior knowledge. Specifically, I worked on localization, mapping, safety control, path and motion planning using ROS (Robotic Operating System).

<br>

<center><b>StyleX</b></center><br>

Although design is not my forte, I did create a personalizable website so you can store all your clothes and belogings online. Not only that, but you can try different outfits on a virtual-YOU to see what looks best. Save the outfits that look good.

	    <center><b>LazyMe</b></center><br>
I built a program to do my Spanish Homework for me. Perdón, Señor Garcia! I had a semesters worth (1000s) of online exercises to do; so I wrote a script to navigate through the exercises and submit all the correct answers for me. I got an A.

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Internships
</h3>

<p><center><b>Facebook</b> </center><br>
I worked on the Instagram Account Security Team in the summer of 2018.
<br><br>

	<p><center><b>Airware, Inc.</b> </center><br>
  <center><a href="http://www.airware.com/industries/view-all">Airware Solutions</a></center><br>
  I orchestrated automated continuous integration tests of the entire Airware cloud with Kubernetes as containerized service. I also
decoupled heavy static data from applications and tests, and lead a data transition to distributed networked file storage systems.
   <br><br>


<p><center><b>Changing Places - MIT Media Lab</b> </center><br>
  <center><a href="http://cp.media.mit.edu/pev/">Visit the Project Site</a></center><br>
  Our Lab’s goal is to autonomize an on-demand, shared, electric buggy transport service. This is in an effort to replace city bike schemes like Citi Cycles in New York, and revolutionize the 'last-mile' commute. I am simulating travel routes with real, public (subway) and private (Uber) transport data across cities. See an example of our protoyped buggies in Boston:

	 <center><b>B2W Digital, Rio de Janeiro</b> </center>	<br>
  <center><a href="https://www.b2wdigital.com/en/institucional/estrategia-e-vantagens-competitivas/">Pricing Team</a></center><br>
	I am using a suite of learning algorithms to price products dynamically. Specifically, I am optmizing product and S&ampH (Shipping and Handling) costs using a suite of Random Forest algorithms.
I am training the algorithms which use a number of variables, like competitor price, traffic data and product stock.<br><br>



 <center><b>Paribus Co.</b> </center>	<br>
  <center><a href="https://paribus.co/">Paribus Home</a></center><br>
I spearheaded a new product feature which scrapes and exploits online hotel bookings’ price inefficiencies. This arbitrating on hotel reservations saved Paribus customers' $50K in its first month. My Hotel Booking saving feature (alongisde Retail and Credit Cards) worked towards Capital One's multi-million dollar acquisition of Paribus.

<p><center><b>Zinc Technologies Inc.</b> </center><br>
	<center><a href="https://zinc.io/">Zinc Products</a></center><br>

I lead a branch of this Y-Combinator graduated company, developing an application for customers to automatically purchase Amazon products over SMS directly. I also automated Zinc's client charges for its automated eCommerce Arbitrage platform<br><br>



<center><b>ALMA Observatory,	Chile</b></center><br>
  	<center><a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/alma.html">Alma Research</a></center><br>

I designed a Graphical User Interface to aid pre-emptive maintenance of the cryostatic systems of ALMA’s Front End system antennas.<br>	<br>






<center><b>Research Science Institute (RSI) at MIT</b></center><br><br>

<center> “Optimizing Dynamic Path Planning Algorithms for Mars Data Collection Mission Using Tailored Gaussian Process”.</center><br>

I conducted research at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Inteligence Laboratories (CSAIL) and presented in a scientific symposium at MIT Sloane. The research paper was awarded ‘Highly Commended’ in the UK National Science and Engineering Competition CompSci category.<br><br>
