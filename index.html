<p> <center><b>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</b></center>	<br>
I currently study Computer Science and Engineering with a Minor in Economics as an undergraduate student at MIT. I intend to attain a masters in CS at MIT, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for efficient optimization.

<p><center><b>Changing Places - MIT Media Lab</b> </center><br>
  <center><a href="http://cp.media.mit.edu/pev/">Visit the Project Site</a></center><br>	
  Our Lab’s goal is to autonomize an on-demand, shared, electric buggy transport service. This is in an effort to replace city bike schemes like Citi Cycles in New York, and revolutionize the 'last-mile' commute. I am simulating travel routes with real, public (subway) and private (Uber) transport data across cities. See an example of our protoyped buggies in Boston:

  <center><a href="https://www.b2wdigital.com/en/institucional/estrategia-e-vantagens-competitivas/">Pricing Team</a></center><br>
	I am using a suite of learning algorithms to price products dynamically. Specifically, I am optmizing product and S$ampH (Shipping and Handling) costs using a suite of Random Forest algorithms.
I am training the algorithms which use a number of variables, like competitor price, traffic data and product stock.<br><br>

	
	
 <center><b>Paribus Co.</b> </center>	<br>	
  <center><a href="https://paribus.co/">Paribus</a></center><br>
I spearheaded a new product feature which scrapes and exploits online hotel bookings’ price inefficiencies. This arbitrating on hotel reservations saved Paribus customers' $50K in its first month. My Hotel Booking saving feature (alongisde Retail and Credit Cards) worked towards Capital One's multi-million dollar acquisition of Paribus.

<p><center><b>Zinc Technologies Inc.</b> </center><br><br>	
	<center><a href="https://zinc.io/">Zinc Website</a></center><br>	

I lead a branch of this Y-Combinator graduated company, developing an application for customers to automatically purchase Amazon products over SMS directly. I also automated Zinc's client charges for its automated eCommerce Arbitrage platform<br><br>

<center><b>ALMA Observatory,	Chile</b></center><br><br>	
  
I designed a Graphical User Interface to aid pre-emptive maintenance of the cryostatic systems of ALMA’s Front End system antennas.<br>	<br>
      					           
<center><b>Research Science Institute (RSI) at MIT</b></center><br><br>
  
<center> “Optimizing Dynamic Path Planning Algorithms for Mars Data Collection Mission Using Tailored Gaussian Process”.</center><br>

I conducted research at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Inteligence Laboratories (CSAIL) and presented in a scientific symposium at MIT Sloane. The research paper was awarded ‘Highly Commended’ in the UK National Science and Engineering Competition CompSci category.<br><br>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Personal Projects</h3>
<center><b>Cryptotrage</b></center><br>
 I have begun a personal project to do with cryptocurrency arbitrage. 
I was an early investor in Bitcoin and am interested not only in the underlying block chain technology but also how these assets are priced online. Using developer APIs and web scraping techniques, there is sometimes an opportunity to find and predict mispricings; I'm trying to take advantage of this.<br><br>
